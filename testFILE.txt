We previously reported about Intel plans to launch several embedded microprocessors along with consumer 
Ivy Bridge mobile parts, all based on not yet released Ivy Bridge (IVB) microarchitecture. 
This quarter Intel will introduce Core i7-3610QE, i7-3612QE, i7-3615QE quad-cores, as well as Core i7-3517UE and i7-3555LE dual-core models.

Additionally, we learned that this quarter the company will offer new embedded Core i5-3610ME model.
